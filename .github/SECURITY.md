## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately by emailing me at  
**andjelicb.ognjen@gmail.com**.

I aim to respond to all reports within 5 business days.  
If a vulnerability is confirmed, I will work to release a fix as soon as possible and notify the reporter once the issue is resolved.

Please **do not** open a public issue for security concerns to avoid disclosure before a fix is available.
