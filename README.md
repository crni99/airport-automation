<br />
<br />

## üõ´ Getting Started
### To run the project locally:
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crni99/airport-automation.git
```
2. **Navigate to the backend API project**
```bash
cd airport-automation/backend/AirportAutomationApi
```
3. **Configure Database Provider and Connection String**
- Open `appsettings.json` and choose your preferred database provider.
- Update the `DatabaseProvider` value to match your choice (`SqlServer`, `Postgres`, or `MySql`).
- Update the corresponding connection string with your local server details, credentials, and port.
```json
"DatabaseProvider": "SqlServer", // <- CHANGE this to your selected provider!
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "SqlServerConnection": "Data Source=YOUR_SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE;Initial Catalog=AirportAutomation;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;",
  "PostgresConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Username=YOUR_USER;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;Database=AirportAutomation",
  "MySqlConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=AirportAutomation;Uid=YOUR_USER;Pwd=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
}
```
4. **Initialize the database**
- You will need to run the appropriate SQL script for your chosen provider to create and seed the database. 
- These scripts are located in **[Data](https://github.com/crni99/airport-automation/tree/main/backend/AirportAutomationInfrastructure/Data)** folder.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Database Provider</th>
      <th>SQL File to Run</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SqlServer</code></td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/crni99/airport-automation/blob/main/backend/AirportAutomationInfrastructure/Data/create_airport_automation_db_mssql.sql"><code>mssql.sql ü°•</code></a></td>
      <td>Execute script against SQL Server instance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Postgres</code></td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/crni99/airport-automation/blob/main/backend/AirportAutomationInfrastructure/Data/create_airport_automation_db_npgsql.sql"><code>npgsql.sql ü°•</code></a></td>
      <td>Execute script against PostgreSQL server (e.g., via pgAdmin).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>MySql</code></td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/crni99/airport-automation/blob/main/backend/AirportAutomationInfrastructure/Data/create_airport_automation_db_mysql.sql"><code>mysql.sql ü°•</code></a></td>
      <td>Execute script against MySQL server (e.g., via MySQL Workbench).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

5. **In your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio / JetBrains Rider):**
- Set `AirportAutomationApi` (Web API) and `AirportAutomationWeb` (MVC Web) as the startup projects.
- This ensures the API and MVC frontend run together.
- Alternatively (using CLI/VS Code): Open two separate terminal windows in the `airport-automation/backend` directory and run the following commands concurrently:
    1. For the **Web API**: `dotnet run --project AirportAutomationApi/AirportAutomationApi.csproj`
    2. For the **MVC Frontend**: `dotnet run --project AirportAutomationWeb/AirportAutomationWeb.csproj`
6. Start the application
```bash
dotnet run
```
### **Optional: To use the React instead of the MVC frontend:**
1. **Navigate to the React frontend**
```bash
cd ../../react-frontend
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Start the React frontend**
```bash
npm run start
```

### Database Setup and Management
- **`SQL Server`** (or a relevant relational database) is used as the primary data store.
- Manage the database schema and migrations via **`Entity Framework Core`** to ensure version control and smooth schema evolution.
- Map EF Core entities directly to database tables to facilitate efficient data access and manipulation.

### Defining RESTful API Endpoints and Implementing Logic to Serve Requested Resources via HTTP
- Establish the foundation of the Web API and define endpoints.
- Implement the logic to retrieve and return resources in response to client requests.

### Manipulating Resources and Validating Input
- Demonstrate how to manipulate data resources and ensure data integrity.

### Working with Services and Dependency Injection
- Employ services and dependency injection to promote modularity and maintainability in the codebase.

### Getting Acquainted with Entity Framework Core
- Utilize Entity Framework Core for database interactions and ORM capabilities within repository and service layers.
- Abstract EF Core queries and commands away from controllers to maintain separation of concerns and improve testability.
- Ensure controllers receive processed data from services, maintaining clean and manageable API endpoints.

### Separation of Concerns with EF Core
- Use EF Core exclusively in repositories and services, keeping controllers free from direct database operations.
- Promote modularity, easier testing, and cleaner controller logic focused on handling HTTP requests and responses.

### Searching, Filtering, and Paging Resources
- Implement advanced features such as searching, filtering, and paging to improve the API‚Äôs usability and performance.

### Exporting Data to PDF and Excel

- Use **`QuestPDF`** to generate high-quality, customizable **`PDF`** documents.
- Use **`ClosedXML`** to create Excel files with structured data, formatting, and support for advanced **`Excel`** features.

### Securing API and CORS Implementation
- Secure the API using robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Passwords are securely stored using the **`BCrypt`** hashing algorithm, which incorporates a robust salt and adaptive iteration count to defend against brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
- Handle authentication with **`JWT tokens`** to enable secure, stateless client-server communication.
- Configure **`CORS`** to allow authorized cross-origin requests while maintaining protection against unauthorized access.

### Role-Based Authorization
- Implement role-based access control with policies:
  - **`RequireSuperAdminRole`**
  - **`RequireAdminRole`**
  - **`RequireUserRole`**
- Enable fine-grained endpoint access control based on user roles to ensure secure handling of sensitive data.

### CORS Policy
- Enable a global CORS policy (**`_AllowAll`**) to facilitate frontend-backend communication during development.
- Plan for more restrictive CORS policies in production environments for enhanced security.

### Versioning and Documenting API with Swagger
- Manage API versions to maintain backward compatibility.
- Document API endpoints for easy use by developers.
- Customize Swagger UI with a toggleable dark/light mode to enhance usability and align with user preferences.

### Logging and Exception Handling for Error Management
- Integrate Serilog for structured, centralized logging, with configuration sourced from app settings.
- Add custom middleware (**`RequestLogContextMiddleware`**) to enrich logs with request context, such as trace identifiers.
- Implement global exception handler middleware (**`GlobalExceptionHandler`**) to standardize error responses and capture unhandled exceptions.

### Middleware Customization
- Implement custom middleware to enhance logging context and provide consistent exception handling, improving diagnostics and debugging.

### Configuration Management
- Centralize all configurations (e.g., Serilog, rate limiting, authentication secrets, pagination settings) in **`appsettings.json`** for better maintainability and environment flexibility.

### API Rate Limiting
- Implement a rate limiter to protect API resources from abuse, mitigate DDoS attacks, and enhance overall API performance.

### Unit Testing with xUnit
- Write comprehensive unit tests using the xUnit framework to validate individual components in isolation.
- Ensure tests improve code reliability, support refactoring, and simplify debugging.

### Monitoring Application Health with HealthChecks

### Managing Data Presentation and User Input
- Handle dynamic data presentation using MVC templates and model binding to ensure consistent and user-friendly data display.
- Develop user input forms with validation to maintain data accuracy and integrity.
- Utilize the modern, responsive design and components of **`Bootstrap 5`** for consistent and high-quality UI styling.

### Client-Side Scripting and AJAX Requests
